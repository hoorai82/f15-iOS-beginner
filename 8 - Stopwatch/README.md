## 8 - Stopwatch

November 2nd, GDC 1.304, 7:00PM - 8:30PM

### What We Did

This week we expanded our Timer app by implementing the second tab with a stopwatch. We've learned the skills necessary to create the stopwatch tab in all of our past workshops: 

* Using `NSTimer`
* Constructing a view with Interface Builder
* Making connections to Interface Builder with `@IBOutlet` and `@IBAction`
* Using `UITableView`

The purpose of this workshop was to solidify those skills, and hopefully answer any questions you had about using them.
