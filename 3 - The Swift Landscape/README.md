### What We Did

* Learned about the grand, all seeing view-controller that manages all of the views on our screen.
* Made a button that iterated over all of the subviews and made every label's text red.
* Made a button that removed a label each time it was pressed by calling the appropriate method on the label.
* Made a button that added a subview to the view-controller's view
* Made an IBAction that removed a button before a user was even done pressing it
