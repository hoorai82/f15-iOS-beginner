## What should I do if I miss a workshop?

Not to worry! All the materials used in the workshop (Including the starting and ending state of whatever we worked on) are neatly organized in folders in this repo. The READMEs in each folder will briefly describe what we did during the workshop so you can get a grasp of what was covered. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to contact Nick or Jesse with the links above or by going to their office hours.
